		The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equater. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 citites.
		</p>
		<p>
		After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and any visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.

		The purpose of this chart, City Latitiude vs. Wind Speed was to higlight how the wind speed readings changed as latitidue decreases and increases from the center at 0. This chart shows a trend that most of the latitude range has more readings of a wind speed < 10 miles per hour. Ther upper latitude range has a few readings of wind speed > 25 miles per hours, while the lower latitudes do not have any readings that high.
