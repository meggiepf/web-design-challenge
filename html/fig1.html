		The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equater. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 citites.
		</p>
		<p>
		After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and any visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.

		The purpose of this chart, City Latitiude vs. Max Temperature was to higlight how the maximum temperature changed as latitidue decreases and increases from the center at 0. This chart has a parabolic shape and indicates that there is greater variation in maximum tempartures as the latitude increases, as compared to when the latitude decreases.
